# EXPORT
#
# Options documentation:
#
# Export permission options available in EXPORT_DEFAULTS, EXPORT, and CLIENT
# blocks. If an option is not set in a more specific block, the next less
# specific block will be considered, until finally the default is taken if
# the option is not specified in any applicable block, following this order:
# CLIENT, EXPORT, EXPORT_DEFAULTS, baked in default.
#
# Access_Type (NONE):	RW, RO, MDONLY, MDONLY_RO, NONE
#			RW allows all opertations
#			RO allows only operations that do not modify the server
#			MDONLY does not allow READ or WRITE operations, but
#				allows any other operation.
#			MDONLY_RO does not allow READ, WRITE, or any operation
#				that modifies file attributes or directory
#				content
#			NONE allows no access at all
#
# Protocols (3,4)	The Protocols allowed. NFSV3, NFSV4, and 9P may be
#			specified. 3, 4, V3, V4, NFS3, and NFS4 may also be
#			used.
#
# Transports (UDP, TCP)	The transport protocols allowed (UDP, TCP, and RDMA may
#			be specified)
#
# Squash (Root_Squash)	What kind of user id squashing is performed:
#			No_Root_Squash, NoIdSquash, None
#				No user id squashing is performed
#			Root, Root_Squash, RootSquash
#				uid 0 and gid 0 are squashed to the
#				Anonymous_Uid and Anonymous_Gid
#				gid 0 in alt_groups lists is also squashed
#			All, All_Squash, AllSquash
#				All users are squashed
#
# Anonymous_Uid (-2)	If a user id is squashed, this is the uid used
#			Ranges from -2147483648 to 4294967295
#			uid are traditionally uint32_t however, tradition
#			has long been to specify NFS anonynmous uid as -2
#			so negative values are allowed
#
# Anonymous_Gid (-2)	If a group id is squashed, this is the gid used
#			Ranges from -2147483648 to 4294967295
#			gid are traditionally uint32_t however, tradition
#			has long been to specify NFS anonynmous gid as -2
#			so negative values are allowed
#
# SecType (none, sys)	The RPC security flavors allowed, none (AUTH_NONE),
#			sys (AUTH_SYS/AUTH_UNIX), krb5 (RPCSEC_GSS),
#			krb5i (RPCSEC_GSS), krb5p (RCSEC_GSS)
#
# PrivilegedPort (false)	If this option is true, client connections
#				must originate from port < 1024. This is
#				tradition based on some operating systems
#				requiring a user to be a privileged user to
#				create a socket with a source port < 1024
#
# Manage_Gids (false)	If this option is true, the alt groups list in
#			AUTH_SYS credentials will be replaced by a server
#			lookup of the group list. This allows bypassing the
#			16 group limit of AUTH_SYS.
#
# Delegations (None)	The types of delegations that may be granted. (None, Read, Write,
#			ReadWrite, R, W, and RW may be specified).
